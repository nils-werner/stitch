Integrations
------------

``stitch`` doesn't make many assumptions, so it works
pretty well with other libraries. For the most part, if it works in the
notebook then it will work in ``stitch``.

Note that source files all use the ``.txt`` extension so they open in
your browser. Typically you'd use ``.md`` or ``.markdown``.
