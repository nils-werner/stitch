Integration With Other Libraries
--------------------------------

``stitch`` doesn't make many assumptions, so it works
pretty well with other libraries. For the most part, if it works in the
notebook then it will work in ``stitch``.

Note that source files all use the ``.txt`` extension so they open in
your browser. Typically you'd use ``.md`` or ``.markdown``.

* Bokeh: :download:`source <ex_bokeh.txt>`, :download:`HTML <ex_bokeh.html>`
* Altair: :download:`source <ex_altair.txt>`, :download:`HTML <ex_altair.html>`
* Holoviews: :download:`source <ex_holoviews.txt>`, :download:`HTML <ex_holoviews.html>`
